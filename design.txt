People push branches to a review repo.

We add a tool for annotating commits with comments, and a web interface for
browsing branches/commenting on commits.

Any branch can be configured to reject pushes unless the new tip commit is
approved.

Push approvals map a branch's name to the approved tip commit.

If a branch's history needs to be rewritten, we recommend doing so and pushing
it as a new branch, so that the old history is not lost. This is one place where
Gerrit's Change-Id approach is superior - it can follow the change through
rebases.
